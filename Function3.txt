Example

network.search(authinfo, options&queryobject, desiredPage, resultsPerPage, callback);

You always request the maximum amount o posts per page you can from the api.
If the desired page is 2 and resultsPerPage is 10, then that means the results 11-20 are the ones you need.
For example with twitter - users/search you can get 20 results per request. Now if resultsPerPage is 10 again but desiredPage is 3,
the first api call returns 20 results. You save & update the users you get from them. 20 results equal 2 pages. We want page 3, so you do a second request in order to get page 3. (Wich is page 2 on twitters api, because the parameter says every 10 results are 1 page)

If I search search/tweets it respons with 100 tweets at a time.If the resultsPerPage parameter is 20, those are 5 pages. So if I want page 4 with 20 results per page, you only need to make one api call and respond with 61-80. If I want page 6 you respond with 1-20 of the second request.

Always save ALL the results you get.
Keep in mind they will not always respond with full maximum amounts of posts. (Limit might be 50, but maybe only responds 5 because only 5 are found)
