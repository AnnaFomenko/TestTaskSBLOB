1. in facebook you use graph.setAccessToken(token); - done
This is an issue. Because there might be 50 calls happening at the same time and you are setting a global value.
Ergo, one call might use another calls token because it was called in the middle. Instead you can do it like this:

graph.get('me?fields=id,about,cover,currency,devices,birthday,link,locale,picture,meeting_for,middle_name,accounts,session_keys,groups,likes,videos,website,family,work,name_format,political,public_key,photos,favorite_teams,favorite_athletes,last_name,email,first_name,name,gender,is_verified,location,interested_in,hometown,quotes,relationship_status,religion,security_settings,significant_other,sports,timezone,updated_time,verified,languages', { access_token: token}, function(err, res) {

This makes sure the call actually uses the token.

2. somehow this call causes the page to be saved with an id of 0 - fixed

3. i asked you that for twitter, ill be able to directly put in the options object as a parameter, so that i could set either a screen_name or user_id to query

4. please add "name" to all tables for users like in the twitter one
